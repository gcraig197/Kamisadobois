Task 3 : Implement use case 1

DEADLINE : Fri 17 March
or Mon 20 March depending when you lab session is;

We're moving on to implementation! The requirements are going to be implemented on a use-case driven basis (i.e. you will build just the functionality to support one more use cases at a time, and not worry about the rest of the system).
Assignment

The first use case to focus on is the two-player game.

The basic features of the two-player game are:

    Enter the players' names and decide who will play as white
    Start the game
    Display the current game board
    Allow the players to both play on the same computer
    Accept legal moves from the keyboard, and reject illegal ones
    Detect when the game is over, and who has won
    Quit at any time.

You will need to demonstrate both the normal game and the speed version of the game.

About the optional parts:
A text interface is all that is required for the project. Note that keyboard input is a requirement.

If you are intending to implement a GUI (see optional parts below), there is no need to demonstrate it until after Easter. If you already have a working GUI, by all means demonstrate it but it will attract no marks.

If you are unable to demonstrate all the features of the two player game, you will score poorly. "Unfinished GUI" is not an excuse.

Notes:

    You will demonstrate the working features of the program to the demonstrator during the your lab session:
        Friday 17th March, for those with Friday labs
        Monday 20th March, for those with Monday labs
    A schedule of demo times will be published : be there at your appointed time!
    No demonstration, no marks.
    In addition you must submit your source files via github the same day that you demonstrate the system.
    This task is worth 7% of the overall mark for the class



Task 4 : Implement use case 2

DEADLINE : Fri 24 March
or Mon 27 March depending when you lab session is;
Assignment

The second use case you have to implement is the one-player game.

The basic features of the one-player game are:

    Everything from Task 3, above, PLUS:
    Allow the user to choose between one- and two-player games
    If one-player is chosen, choose the difficultly level of the AI
    The computer player should make a move in less than 5 seconds when it is its turn.
    Instead of making a move, the human may undo their previous move (and the computer's previous move) and return the board to its previous state.
    You should be able to save a game in progress and resume after quitting and restarting the program.
    All of the above for both speed and normal versions of the game

The general remarks from Task 3 apply to this Task too.

Notes:

    You will demonstrate the working features of your program to the demonstrator during the your lab session:
        Friday 24th March, for those with Friday labs
        Monday 27st March, for those with Monday labs
    No demonstration, no marks.
    In addition you must submit your source files via github the same day that you demonstrate the system.
    This task is worth 7% of the overall mark for the class.
